# Tuples are a heterogeneous (mixed types), immutable data structure
# How to pronounce, from the Python creator:
"""
I pronounce tuple too-pull on Mon/Wed/Fri and tub-pull on Tue/Thu/Sat. 
On Sunday I don't talk about them. :) 
"""
# The look like an ordered pair in math

# Make tuple with two items

# Make tuple with one item


# You access elements from them using [ ] just like strings



# Also like strings, you can only concatenate tuples with other tuples

# I heard you like tuples...
# so you can also put tuples inside your tuples
# need two [] to access them.

"""
In the file linear_calculations.py, complete the slope and distance
function. Each function takes in two tuples, representing two (x,y) points,
and returns the slope or distance as a float.
